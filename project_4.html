        <p class="text">As you can see above once I had read in the various libraries and the dataset used I sat and conjured up a few questions and tasks I believed to be interesting. After noticing an odd number of rows in the ‘top 10 highest earning athletes’ I wanted to know the reason why, and it was quickly established that 2002 had two athletes earning the same so consequently was a list of eleven athletes.</p>
        <p class="text">Floyd ‘Money’ Mayweather sure lived up to his name as he was the answer to my first question of who had earned the most in a single year. In 2015 Mayweather had earned an outstanding $300 million, doing a quick search explained how he had earned this incredible amount, he competed twice that year including a highly coveted Pacquiao fight which broke financial boxing records.</p>
        <p class="text">Over the course of time the greatest earner, head and shoulders above everyone is Tiger Woods. The iconic golfer had many major sponsorship deals including Accenture, AT&T, EA Sports, Gatorade, Gillette, Golf Digest, NetJets, Nike, Tag Heuer, TLC Laser Eye and Upper Deck 		        (source: https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronsirak/2018/04/18/tiger-woods-a-remade-man-or-simply-rebranded/?sh=47f42deb2224). Notably the top six highest earners still compete today: Tiger Woods, Lebron James, Floyd Mayweather, Cristano Ronaldo, Federer and Lionel Messi.</p>
        <p class="text">Furthermore, I wanted to see who earned the most over five-year span to see how it changed over the years. Michael Jordan dominated the 90s as he earned $169.9million in the first half, and almost doubled it in the second. Tiger woods then took over during the 2000s with an impressive run from 2005-2010 earning $607million and finally in the 2010’s it was Mayweather’s time to takeover.</p>
        <p class="text">Turning the focus on the highest earners each year I wanted to plot out to get an insight into the rate at which earnings increased. As you can see above, the table of results show a general steady increase throughout the 30 years and the two outstanding years Floyd Mayweather had in 2015 and 2018. The graph illustrates the same information visually with a steady upward trajectory. I went on a small detour to see how the earnings of an individual athlete would differ so I considered Cristiano Ronaldo (CR7). His earnings personally shot up and dramatically from 2013 to 2014 and remained high thereafter, I believe there is a few reasons to explain it. Perhaps the run of four Champions League championships in five year played a significant role, or maybe a return on investment from his own CR7 fashion and fragrance brand, or the two hotels he opened, maybe it’s a common path for elite athletes where initially their earnings are stable as they’re still making their mark in their profession, then as they become more successful they have more exposure to brand deals, bigger contracts and investment opportunities.</p>
        <p class="text">After more cleaning of the data such as renaming some sports I produced a map illustrating the highest earning sports in the last graph. Right out in front comes basketball, with a massive league filled with some of the most elite athletes like Michael Jordan, Lebron James, Kobe Bryant etc. it seemed reasonable, however despite being head and shoulders above everyone else in the top 10 what was interesting is that basketball was only ranked 1st six times, all won by Michael Jordan. Boxing followed being the top 10 over 40 times and I suspect the ability boxers have to produce their own shows and receive individual sponsors have a major role to play. </p>
