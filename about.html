        <h2 class="header_section">About Me</h2>
        <p class="about_text">You are most likely here doing further research after inspecting my CV. I have set up this GitHub repository showcasing my experience and skills with the goal of landing my dream job in tech. This about me page will provide greater context of who I am and what is stated on my CV. Everything here, including the HTML, CSS and Python for the projects is produced myself, I hope you enjoy your time here and feel free to contact me via email – <a class="about_text" target="_blank" href="mailto:michaelcapaldi10@gmail.com">michaelcapaldi10@gmail.com</a></p>
        <h2 class="header_section">Location & Education</h2>
        <p class="about_text">In 1996 I was born in Enfield, North London and have resided here ever since. Coming from a working class blue collar family, my parents have constantly worked hard even until this day to provide for us the quality of life we enjoy with the attitude of ‘if you want something in life you must go out and work for it’. Consequently, my parents engrained a strong work ethic and conscientiousness within me that has been the bedrock of whatever I have pursued growing up and professionally. Attending a local modest comprehensive school, I was abruptly exposed to gang violence, knife crime, drug abuse and other associations indicative of low-socioeconomic background. Thankfully from the guide of my parents and selected friends around me I realised that it was up to me to navigate a successful path and avoid routes the majority of other pupils took.</p>
        <p class="about_text">After receiving my GCSE results it became clear to me I had a natural desire and passion for the STEM fields, the apparent logical approach formulating your reasoning sat well with me and therefore decided to enrol into Maths, Physics and Economics A-Levels.</p>
        <h2 class="header_section">University</h2>
        <p class="about_text">Inspired and encouraged by my teachers I applied to university and was accepted onto the Physics course at the University of Kent, Canterbury. I can say whole-heartedly it was the best decision I have made to date, there is no feeling like being at university surrounded by great academics, a great social setting and studying a subject you have real passion. Physics has done an immense amount for me personally and incidentally prepared me for life in the real world; the daily challenges faced by the rigorous course develop skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, organisational, perseverance and many more. Furthermore, it was here where I was first introduced to creating, using and optimising tech via coding.  In the first computing module we were taught the basics of an older syntax Fortran 95, simple assigning variables, for loops and if/else statements gave me a small insight into an area of knowledge that I would eventually grow to love. As I progressed through the years I’d start to apply another language ‘MatLab’ to our practical investigations in the lab by visualising data and computing extremely complicated mathematical functions. </p>
        <p class="about_text">My final year at university was simultaneously the most challenging academically but also the enjoyable and rewarding. The biggest highlight of that year was leading our ‘Group Project’ which involved working with an industry partner to solve an issue the firm presented. We worked with Convert Energy, a small firm that creates bespoke alternative energy solutions to their clients.  We helped them design, simulate and create a prototype of an ‘Atmospheric Water Generator’ (AWG). Essentially it extracts the moisture from the air and sterilises it to become drinking water whilst being completely powered by solar panels, with the idea for it to be used in emergency situations like an earthquake or areas where drinking water is not easily accessible. The team and I decomposed the challenge into smaller tasks and as project manager I delegated each task to the person I believed to be the most competent. The project was assessed over many factors including a poster, presentation and the heavily weighted report, thankfully it was a success and incidentally received an award for achieving the highest mark out of all the other group taking part.</p>
        <h2 class="header_section">Experience</h2>
        <p class="about_text">After university, based on a number of reasons I decided I wanted to pass on the knowledge I studied for and loved by starting my professional career in teaching. After the two challenging years I can honestly say there is nothing to prepare you to stand up in front of 30 pupils and take on the trial and tribulations that accompany it. In my first year or training year, I had to adapt quickly and deal with being thrown in at the deep end by taking on GCSE classes from the get go, it was difficult but I wouldn’t of chose another way as 'learning by doing' is best practice for me. Despite the ups and downs of that year I achieved an ‘Outstanding’ assessment of my teaching by my training provider and was awarded a permanent position at the school I trained at. The second year I really got into my stride, although still new to teaching my head of department gave me the responsibility of a top set GCSE physics class which it rare for my age and teaching experience at the time but is testimony of what he thought of my ability. The past two years I learnt more than I could of imagined and raised my level as a person, however I wanted another challenge so I decided it was time to change career and move into what I enjoyed at university – tech.</p>
        <h2 class="header_section">Passion For Tech</h2>
        <p class="about_text">On the side of teaching I was always teaching myself coding using online resources, first from YouTube videos then eventually purchasing a few courses on Udemy. Personally I believe the mind-set and skills needed for coding align well to those I picked up and developed during my A-levels and degree. The courses engaged me plus kept me curious to learn more, so after a course in the fundamentals of Python I took a hand to SQL followed by Data Science and Machine Learning. Working with data has peaked my interests and has consolidated my passion for tech and data and so here we are with this portfolio dedicated to it.</p>
